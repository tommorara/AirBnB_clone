# 0x00. AirBnB Clone - The Console

## Description

Welcome to the AirBnB clone project! This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. The purpose of this project is to develop a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.

This console will be a powerful tool in the development process, allowing for a simple flow of serialization/deserialization of instance objects to and from JSON strings and files, along with managing the objects of our project: creating new objects (e.g., a new User or a new Place), retrieving an object, performing operations on objects, updating attributes of an object, and destroying an object.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, participants should be able to explain:

- How to create a Python package.
- How to create a command interpreter in Python using the `cmd` module.
- The importance and implementation of unit testing in a large project.
- How to serialize and deserialize a Class.
- How to write and read a JSON file.
- How to manage datetime.
- What an UUID is and its utility.
- The usage of *args and **kwargs and how to handle named arguments in a function.

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.8.5).
- All files should end with a new line.
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- Your code should use the `pycodestyle` (version 2.8.*).
- All your files must be executable.
- Your code should be documented.

### Python Unit Tests

- All test files should be inside a `tests` folder.
- You have to use the `unittest` module for your tests.
- All your test files should be python files (extension: .py).
- The organization of your test files in the `tests` folder should mimic your project structure.
- Execute all your tests with: `python3 -m unittest discover tests`.
- Individual tests can be executed with: `python3 -m unittest <test_file>`.

## Usage

Detailed instructions on how to use the console will be provided later in the project documentation.
